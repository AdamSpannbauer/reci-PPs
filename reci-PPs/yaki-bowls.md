### Steps

1. Whisk soy sauce, granulated sugar, brown sugar, 4 minced garlic cloves, ginger, black pepper, and cayenne.  
2. Put chicken in a shallow dish and pour half the sauce over it; cover and set aside.  
3. Pour remaining sauce into a saucepan; simmer about 10 minutes.  
4. Whisk cornstarch with ~1 Tbsp water; stir into simmering sauce.  
5. Simmer until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon; remove from heat.  
6. Toss broccolini with 2 Tbsp olive oil and 1 minced garlic clove.  
7. Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high; cook broccolini until charred and tender (about 3–4 min per side). Remove and set aside.  
8. Return skillet to heat; add 2 Tbsp olive oil.  
9. Drain chicken and pat dry, then add to skillet.  
10. Cook chicken until golden and no longer pink (about 6–8 minutes).

12. Divide rice into bowls; top with broccolini and chicken.  
13. Garnish with green onions, toasted sesame seeds, and red pepper flakes (optional).
