### Steps

1. Make a cup of coffee and put on some music.  
2. Preheat oven to 325°F; place rack in center.  
3. Line a baking sheet with parchment.  
4. Spread almonds on a sheet and toast ~12 minutes, tossing halfway; do not let them burn.  
5. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, and salt.  
6. In a large bowl, whisk eggs; add olive oil, sugars, extracts, and zest.  
7. Remove almonds from oven; coarsely chop.  
8. Mix wets and dry gently—do not overmix.  
9. Fold in chopped almonds once they have cooled.  
10. Scoop dough onto the parchment-lined sheet into two adjacent logs.  
11. With damp fingers, shape logs (slightly thicker logs hold shape better).  
12. Bake ~30 minutes, until golden and firm.  
13. Clean up while you wait—love yourself.  
14. Cool 10 minutes; slice into 1/2-inch pieces with a serrated knife.  
15. Return slices to oven 15–20 minutes, flipping halfway; bake longer for crispier biscotti.  
16. Transfer to wire rack to cool.  
17. Optional: dip in chocolate (does not travel as well).

My favorite Christmas cookie. Delicious, forgiving, and produces excellent scraps while making it.  
Time: ~2 hours. Makes about 3 dozen.
