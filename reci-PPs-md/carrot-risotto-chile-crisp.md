### Steps

1. Heat oven to 400°F.  
2. Prep carrots: shred ¾ lb and set aside; slice remaining carrots on a sharp diagonal about ¼-inch thick.  
3. Toss sliced carrots with 2 Tbsp chile crisp; season generously with salt and pepper.  
4. Bake carrots until tender, about 15 minutes, stirring halfway through.  
5. Add stock to a lidded saucepan and warm over low heat.  
6. In a medium saucepan, melt 2 Tbsp butter over medium-high heat.  
7. Add shredded carrots, shallot, garlic, and coriander; season with salt and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.  
8. Add wine and cook until mostly evaporated, about 3 minutes.  
9. Stir in rice, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring, about 2 minutes.  
10. Add 1 cup warm stock and cook, stirring frequently, until almost absorbed (about 3 minutes).  
11. Repeat adding stock 4 more times, stirring until absorbed each time.  
12. When rice is tender and creamy, stir in Parmesan and remaining 2 Tbsp butter until silky and well combined.  
13. Season risotto to taste with salt and pepper.  
14. Divide among bowls and top with roasted carrots.  
15. Serve with additional chile crisp drizzled on top.
