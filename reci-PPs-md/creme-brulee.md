### Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 325°F.  
2. Place the cream, vanilla bean, and its pulp into a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil.  
3. Remove from the heat, cover, and allow to sit for 15 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean and reserve for another use.  
4. In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar and the egg yolks until well blended and just starting to lighten in color.  
5. Add the cream a little at a time, stirring continually.  
6. Pour the liquid into 6 (7–8 oz) ramekins.  
7. Place the ramekins into a large cake pan or roasting pan and pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins.  
8. Bake until the crème brûlée is set but still trembling in the center, approximately 40–45 minutes.  
9. Remove the ramekins from the roasting pan and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.  
10. Remove from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before browning the sugar on top.  
11. Divide the remaining 1/2 cup sugar equally among the dishes and spread evenly on top.  
12. Using a torch, melt the sugar and form a crispy top.  
13. Allow the crème brûlée to sit for at least 5 minutes before serving.
