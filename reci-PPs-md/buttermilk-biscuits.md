### Steps

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).  
2. Shred the frozen butter on a box grater (large shreds).  
3. Dust a workspace lightly with flour.  
4. Pour buttermilk into a separate container so the jug stays clean.  
5. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  
6. Set out cast iron pan and biscuit cutter beside workspace.  
7. Work butter into the dry mix with fingers until it resembles coarse crumbs.  
8. Make a well; add 1 cup buttermilk.  
9. Mix gently—start with a spoon, finish with hands; add a splash more buttermilk if dough is dry.  
10. Turn dough out; form a rectangle. Fold in half, flatten, fold again—repeat several times.  
11. Cut biscuits; rework scraps to cut a few more.  
12. Arrange biscuits in cast iron so they lightly touch.  
13. Bake 20–30 minutes, depending on biscuit size.
