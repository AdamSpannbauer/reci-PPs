**Notes**

Get a muffin-size Bundt cake pan thing for donut effect - but really cupcakes more than nuts.

**Apple Cider:**  5 apples, 1 orange, 2 cinnamon sticks, 1 t. pumpkin pie spice. Quarter fruit, put in pot with spices, cover with water.  Simmer ~2 hrs until soft, mash, simmer 15 more, strain.
